                Explanation of the Answer: <br>
                <br>
                The first area of the right-angle triange which is calculated, areaValue1, is simply calculated by multiplying the first two double inputs 
                from the user (adjacentSide & oppositeSide), divided by 2. The second calculated area, areaValue2, is type casting the areaValue1 from a double
                to an integer, therefore leaving it as a whole number, removing the decimal place values of .6048. Lastly, areaValue3 type casts areaValue2 
                from an integer back to a double. Therefore, 850 (areaValue2) is converted to 850.0 and not 850.6048 as it was previously.
