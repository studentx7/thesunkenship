                <p>
                    Blimey! Thank you pirate, you've helped us locate the treasure for this sunken ship! We'd like to send our many thanks for adventuring with us.
                    <p>
                        Hopefully along the way, you have acquired a new set of knowledge about programming and the topics of variables, data types, conditional statements, loops and arrays! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the mission is a success, we will have to part ways here. Looking forward until our next journey together! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ahoy me hearties! 
                    </p>
