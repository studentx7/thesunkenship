                Well done! The integer variable ammo and sharkSoup are initially 10 and 0 respectively. The while loop executes as loong as ammo is greater than 0, and each time it does the value of sharpSoup is increased by 1 and the value of ammo decreases by 1. This continues until ammo equals 1 and the expression ammo > 0 is thus false, at which point the value of sharkSoup is 10. The code then prints out Shark soup servings for crew: 10.
